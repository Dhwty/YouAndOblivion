# You And Oblivion
## A Disco Elysium Fan-game :: Be Gay; Solve Crimes

## What are we using?

## Who are we?
You and Oblivion was written by the Kirkwall Gazette Collective, a group of people brought together by our love for Dragon Age, who have now gone on to inflict our sense of humour on other fandoms.

## Where can I play this game?
While we're still working on it, you can check out the busted-ass pre-alpha version [here](https://dhwty.github.io/YouAndOblivion/dist/). It's Twine, so all you need is a relatively modern browser (I can get it to work in FF 57) with javascript enabled.
