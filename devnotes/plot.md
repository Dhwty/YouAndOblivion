### Blue Book Murder, the best we could

*   **Scene:** An apartment building in Jamrock. Garte lives in the neighbouring apt.
*   **Victim:** Kim's flavour of the week, one **_Jean-François Poulin_**
*   **Murderer:** Cunoesse
*   **Motives:** 
    *   (for the frame) Cunoesse is pissed at Harry for trying to steal Cuno from her. Kim's not Harry, but without Kim, Harry's going to end up back in the gutter and will no longer be a threat. 
    *   (for the murder) Strung out M. Poulin almost fatally hit-and-run Cuno. Fuck him.
*   **Cause of death:** a blow to the head, probably the face.
*   **Murder weapon:** Kim's prybar, still bloody, right next to the body
*   **Witnesses:** Garte, Cuno, (Cunoesse?). Other neighbours? At least one deaf neighbour. Give us disability rep AND the fun of watching Harry try/fail/succeed to communicate because this is a crapsack world. I'm just picturing Harry making up his own sign language. Oh no.

### Subtle Was the Serpent

*   **Victim:** Still **_Jean-François Poulin_**
*   **Perp:** **_Philippe Géroux_**
*   **Weapon:** (a Seolite poison that needs a name)
*   **Witnesses:** Garte, probably, but he doesn't know what he's seen.
*   **Evidence:** Processing finds evidence of the poison in the body. This plot shouldn't trigger until Day 2.
*   **What the fuck went on here:**
    *   The neighbour across the hall (Philippe Géroux) wants Kim out of the way, so he's slowly poisoning Jean-François with a Seolite poison, so it'll eventually make him \*sick\* and Philippe can save the day, and reveal that Kim's the poisoner. This will obviously make Jean-François fall in love with him, instead! Except Cunoesse walks into the middle of this and clocks the guy with Kim's prybar. Now the guy's dead, Philippe didn't see who did it, and Philippe \*THINKS IT'S KIM\*, because he hates Kim.

#### Notes on poison
*   The poison doesn’t necessarily have to be Seolite in nature, just in availability. For example, best poisons for our use are historically are things used as _rat poisons_ (cyanide, thallium, etc). As long as this implies a Seolite connection, we’re golden. 
*   i.e. A commonly used pesticide was banned over a decade ago in Revachol because it was too dangerous for the citizenry to have access to. It was banned in Revachol because it was extremely popular for political assassinations? Git that communard aspect in? It has _not_ been banned in Seol, where it is still easily procured on the open market. Like,  at the supermarket levels of easy.
*   Someone unscrupulous and with plenty of connections (say for example, one Evrart Claire) would have no problem getting some, and it’s through this chain that Poulin gets his. (Maybe through a brother who’s Union?)

### Kim Kitsuragi Was Never Called An Asshole

*   Not in (what the hell district is 57?)
*   Kim gets arrested/taken in for questioning on the basis of the evidence late day 2/early day 3 -- the report from Processing has to have come back, and the neighbours all report Kim having been a frequent visitor, including the night before.
*   Jean Vicquemare (spelling) comes to take him away and pick up the Kineema. Kim loses his shit about the car. Harry can:
    *   leave it for Processing (don't move the car, you'll destroy evidence) \[Rhetoric check\]
    *   drive the car safely back to the precinct \[Volition check\]
    *   listen to the necktie (GO FAST! ALL SIRENS!) \[No check, and the same as failing the volition check\]
*   All of these result in Processing coming up with results from the car that show surprisingly few of Kim's fingerprints, compared to Harry's and no evidence related to the crime -- no fluids from the victim, no traces of poison, obviously not the prybar because it's in the apt. NOT driving the car results in Harry's fat ass not rubbing off a bloodstain -- turns out it's Harry's blood, from that time somebody hit him with a bin lid, last week. Bloody handkerchief under the seat is Kim's, but the blood is still Harry's.
*   Quest completes when you give Kim back his car keys.

#### Suspects:
    1. Kim
    2. Garte
    3. Poisoner
    4. Either child
    5. Harry himself  



### A Few Notes From the (Homo-Sexual) Underground (Secret Task?)

*   Harry keeps calling Kim his 'partner'. People assume they're dating.
*   Kim keeps trying to correct them. Until he's fed up and just leans into it. Probably because it gets them info/intel; Kim can be notoriously private, but he wants this solved already, dammit. And he also wants the D(etective).
*   This is the plot that eventually becomes the romance.



### COUNTING THE DAYS

#### **Murder Timeline**

1. Attempted murderer **Philippe Géroux** procures poison, begins administering it in small doses to M. Poulin.
2. M. Poulin becomes increasingly erratic due to low-grade hypoxia, hallucinations, mounting delirium, and intermittent neuronal compromise. This has two main effects:
3.
    *   a. His relationship with Kim, such as it is, becomes strained (Kim thinks he has an out-of-control addiction). It finally fractures. 
    *   b. Poulin does develop substance abuse problems, going from casual and social use to more out-of-control in an attempt to offset whatever’s wrong with him. Spoiler: It doesn’t help. And it does mean there’s plenty of evidence to support Kim’s suspicions of addiction.
4. One night, Poulin sideswipes Cuno driving home, almost killing him. Cuno, high as a kite, is mildly injured but ecstatic. Cunoesse is livid.
5. Cunoesse, being a half-feral homicidal tweaker/homophobe, decides this guy’s gonna get his, and is the actual murderer. 
6. The night he dies, Kim’s the last one to see him alive. They have an argument that ends in Kim storming away (which, of course, is witnessed by M. Géroux, solidifying his assumption that Kim’s the killer.)
7. Kim goes back the next morning with a cooler head, to smooth things over and hopefully get his shit back. He finds Poulin dead. He smokes because he's alive and he can and _oh fucking shit_, and then he goes for Harry.

#### Day 0

*   Kim gets laid
*   Kim argues with Jean-François about his socket set and storms out with two effects:
    *   Kim grabs the wrong cigarettes, not realising he already took his
    *   Kim slams the door so hard it bounces back open
*   Jean-François passes out where he is, because poison
*   Cunoesse comes up to loot the place while Jean-François is passed out
    *   Jean-François wakes up and tries to throw her out
    *   Cunoesse kills Jean-François with Kim's prybar and steals the socket set because it looks expensive
*   Cuno still stoned out of his mind on painkillers because car accident, knows none of this

#### Day 1

*   Cuno goes to deliver package to Jean-François or neighbour, finds body, assumes Kim or Martin killed him.
*   Kim comes back for his notebook, finds Jean-François dead, calls Harry Is Harry at home? At work?Harry's at home, because character creation with Ancient Reptilian Brain.
*   Harry stops at the precinct to grab anything related to the address, and spots the noise complaint from the night before (it's actually Kim/Jean-François not the murder) Gotta figure out how If he's at work, he might see it written in records/hear somebody else mention it at work?
*   Field autopsy
*   Get prybar
*   Interview neighbours
*   Discover alley and talk to Cuno??

#### Night 1

*   Go to bar
*   Change into leather jackets
    *   Kim finds an extra pack of smokes, can't remember why, combines with the good pack from the right pocket
*   Kim has a small number of drinks and smokes one 'stale' cigarette
*   Drunk!Kim

#### Day 2

*   Kim gets arrested (because poison and spooge) and the car gets taken in
    *   Why spooge? Does DE have DNA processing?
    *   Maybe not arrested so much as brought in and held for questioning.
    *   You can have the lab run a test on the dead guy's \*ahem\* in game, so I'm guessing yes to some sort of DNA processing? Maybe?
    *   AHAHAHA OMG WHAT
*   Interview neighbours without Kim
*   Talk to Cuno again (MAYBE CUNO FUCKING CARES gained)
*   Kim spends the night in jail

#### Day 3

*   Get Kim back from Vic
*   Negotiate with Vic for the Kineema ($stationRep bonus)
*   Complete MAYBE CUNO FUCKING CARES
*   Talk to Cuno without Cunoesse, Cuno now more afraid of Cunoesse than anything else


### Thought Cabinet options:

*   Kim's Ass/THIS MAN HAS NO ASS
    *   Temporary effect: - 1 Perception (it requires all your concentration to find what little ass there is) or - 1 Esprit de Corps (everyone can see you staring at Kim's ass. Even Kim.)
    *   End result: bonus to Visual Calculus to identify the owner of a buttprint found in Dead Guy's apartment.
*   CUNO DOESN'T FUCKING CARE/MAYBE CUNO FUCKING CARES
    *   End result: +1 Empathy with Cuno? Maybe adds Cuno to Esprit de Corps? This should be how you turn Cuno so he tells the truth about Cunoesse.
    *   Whatever the reason Cuno is in the neighbourhood, this Thought Cabinet can be unlocked by seeing him _sober._ Sober, he's got the half-assed posturing of a twelve-year old. The meth does a lot of the heavy DOESN'T FUCKING CARE lifting. Also, being somewhere between jonesing and withdrawal is gonna compromise any composure or ability to lie he has.
*   Why is Tie? 
    *   Why is your tie like this? What triggers your tie? Is your tie your subconscience, or is your tie \*actually\* haunted? 
    *   End result: Can choose between +1 Electrochemistry or +1 Volition (depends on the conclusion you come to - Electrochem if you recognise Tie as your subconscious \[which is a stupid unspellable word\],  Volition if you conclude it's haunted \[or an audio hallucination\] and not to be listened to)

### Spare Interactions, sprinkle as needed:

*   Harry: *says something particularly stupid* 
*   Kim: *takes off his glasses and tucks them away* I need to see less of you right now.

*   Harry: *fails a check with snake-eyes
*   Tie: WOMP WOMP, BRATAN 

*   *Harry has the chance to buy booze* 
*   Tie: BRATAN! THE SWEET NECTAR! I MUST HAVE IT! I MUST! 
*   Ancient Reptilian Badger Brain: Ah. A *joke*. You're... not particularly funny, you know. 

*   You do something particularly stupid (e.g. accuse Kim of murder):
    *   "It is a blustery day in Jamrock, and you are a terrible cop."

*   'He's got an ass flat enough to snort coke off'
