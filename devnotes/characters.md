## Character Notes

### Kim
*   Kim's jacket gives +1 to Volta do Mar, which means he's functionally a poet, with a speciality in forms used by paledrivers to navigate and survive the Pale.
*   According to him he's 100% Vacholiere, having never been to Seol, and having grown up without a word of the language
*   Will NOT let you drive his Kineema

### Harry
*   Is a lot less drunk, resulting in better, and possibly better \*balanced\* stats
*   The necktie is still talking to him.
*   Keeps calling himself Kim's partner. People assume they're dating.

### Cuno
*   doesn't fucking care
*   Martinaise is a very small island, controlled by the Union, and it most likely doesn't have a school. If it ever had one, it's likely it was closed due to lack of students. But, Cuno's desk canonically has homework on it. He most likely goes to school over the bridge, in Jamrock, but the bridge is closed during the events of DE, which is why he's CONSTANTLY THERE.
*   Could easily be there because he's in a detention centre or halfway house of some kind, a Home for Wayward Youth
*   OKAY we got this. Combining Mav's "maybe he's dealing drugs" with the canonically ill-guarded truck supposedly carrying drugs, we get Cuno stole a shitton of drugs from a truck during DE and now that the bridge is down, he's selling them in a better neighbourhood.

### Cunoesse
*   She consistently swears in Finnish and occasionally lapses into it for other words and phrases
*   Canonically, she's killed before.
*   She doesn't have a name. She's 'Cuno, but a girl', because she can't remember who she is, canonically.

### Garte
*   Is perpetually fed up with this shit
*   Initially refuses to speak to Harry. This can be an Insight check of some kind. Also depends on whether Kim is present.
    *   Easy: He's not just his normal obstinate self. He's being cagey, hiding something.
    *   Harder: He's having a really hard time looking at Kim; he's not talking _because Kim is there_. 

### Jean-François Poulin
*   Sees Kim on \*Sundays\*, when his \*Smoking Friend\* is otherwise occupied...

### Phillipe Geroux
*   Pining for Poulin in full creeper mode.
*   Hates Kim's guts for getting that when he wishes he was.
*   How well is he hiding his disdain for Kim/grief for Poulin?

### Horrific Necktie
*   Deserves its own character thing, really
*   Driven by a desire to be drunk, high, and naked (except for tie)
*   Insults everyone, everything, everywhere
*   Canonically only heard by Harry, but ... if Kim wore The Tie ... could Kim hear it?
*   If you listen to Tie too much you'll probably die or something
*   Is Tie your subconscious? Is Tie haunted? Audio hallucination? \*Does it really matter?\* Is the tie related to the Pale? Did somebody forget their tie there for too long before it was retreived?
